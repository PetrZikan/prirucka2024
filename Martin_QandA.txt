Martin:
How to initiate a simulation?

AI:
To initiate a simulation, you need to follow these steps:

1. Prepare the input for the simulation using SIMPUT files, which involves defining the necessary properties and parameters.
2. Once the SIMPUT file exists, you can run the simulation.

These steps ensure that the simulation is set up correctly before execution.
