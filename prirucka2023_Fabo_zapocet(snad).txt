Question: "Is there some relation between period and eccentricity in binary star?"

Content: of the eccentricities for the longer-period binaries is clearly vis-
ible. See the more detailed discussion of the Pâe relation in the
next section.
========================================
Metadata: {}
Content: Many systems have detected third-light contributions, which means that the Kozai-Lidov cycles might also be responsible for the high
eccentricities in some of the binaries.
========================================
Metadata: {}
Content: some real change in eccentricity can be detected. The highly
eccentric binaries should be most strongly aï¬ected.
The whole situation is clearly more complicated because

Generated Response:
Yes, there is a relation between period and eccentricity in binary stars, as indicated by discussions of the period-eccentricity relation in the retrieved context. The period-eccentricity diagram shows a distinction between different types of stars, suggesting that the eccentricity of binaries can be influenced by their orbital period. Additionally, it is mentioned that highly eccentric binaries should be more affected by changes in eccentricity.
